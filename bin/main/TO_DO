public String toString() {
		String mess = shipName + " Properties:";
		mess += "\nDamage Multiplier: " + damageMultiplier;
		mess += "\nAll damage received is multiplied by this before being applied (lower is better).";
		mess += "\nAttack Multiplier: " + attackMultiplier;
		mess += "\nAll damage given is multiplied by this before being applied (higher is better).";
		mess += "\nCrew Size: " + shipCrew;
		mess += "\nMax Inventory Capacity: " + maxCapacity;
		
		return mess;
